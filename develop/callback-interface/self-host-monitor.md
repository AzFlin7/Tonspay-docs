# üñ®Ô∏è Self host monitor

Due to different reasons , including ISP not spport . Not every merchant are willing to publish it's server - port or ip address for callback .

So the [Tonspay-monitor](https://github.com/Tonspay/Tonspay-monitor) is opensource for self host . It require network connection for out-bound only , anyone can host it to listen to it's own invoice.
